                        She has contributed to the Processing Foundation as an open source 
                        enthusiast and uses p5 to create fun pattern based art. 
                        She is currently based out of Bangalore and enjoys exploring the food in the city. 
                        Her day job is at Microsoft, India where works on front end technologies.

                        The talk will go over creating pieces in 2D in square based and hexagon based grid systems using p5. 
                        It will start with just understanding patterns, then some basic code/math to see how we create grids in p5. 
                        Finally, there will be some live coding involved and a pre-sketch where people with their laptops can try to create their own works of art.

                    <h2 class="speaker_name">Arjun</h2>
                    <p class="speaker_blurb">Arjun is passionate about the interplay between humans and computers. 
                        He wonders what could be produced if fast, accurate, stupid machines work in symbiosis with slow, inaccurate, 
                        brilliant human beings to produce creative output. 
                        A designer, through & through, Arjun currently works as a design researcher in the day with TinkerLabs, 
                        attempting to solve complex social problems with behaviour design. At night, he experiments with algorithms to produce images.                         
                        An advocate of interdisciplinary approaches, he previously worked with Science Gallery Bengaluru as an Xperimenter, 
                        producing public engagement programmes for young adults to interface with the sciences.

                    <h3 class="speaker_talk_topic">In Between Life & Death - Breaking Down The Making</h3>
                    <p class="speaker_talk_brief">In Between Life & Death is a web-game, made with p5.js, that attempts to explore why human beings do the things they do. 
                        Using Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs as the underlying system, players wake up as a 'conscious' particle in space compelled 
                        by different human 'needs'. As the game progresses, fulfilling the needs becomes increasingly more complex, and players ultimately 
                        reach a grand ending - but is there one at all? 
                        Dive into a zone of existential questioning as Arjun deconstructs the process of making his game - discussing the inspiration, 
                        conversion of Maslow's theory into a system of logic, stylistic choices and its resulting impact.

                        She explores the intersection of art, stories, poetry and the human condition. 
                        She plays with circuits, code, experience design, learning design, poems, narratives, mixed-media, new media, trans-media tools, 
                        cocktail mixers and whatever else catches her fancy. She does research, design, create and facilitate in spaces ranging 
                        from a corporate to science museums to art galleries. She has displayed a collaborative project, Plastic Prayaschitta as 
                        a part of BeFantastic AI Art Festival 2023 and was a part of Goethe Institute's C3: Code, Creativity, Communities cohort.

                    <p class="speaker_talk_brief">The talk will capture exploration of generating poetry with code from the basics using 
                        arrays and markov chains to blackout poetry to using GPT3 as a collaborator. It will highlight experiences of how 
                        as humans we give meaning to randomness and those where the machines nudged a subliminal experience. It will cover 
                        ways to play with tools like p5.js, rita.js, GPT3, some python.

                        When he's bored you can find him making absurdist memes, yet another spotify playlist or staring straight into the void.

                        Sonic-pi by looking at how different programming concepts like data structures, conditional statements etc 
                        can be used to create intuitive compositions and of course some dope beats!

                    <p class="speaker_blurb">Rohan Jhunja is a Product Designer working with early-stage startups. 
                        His projects span across AI Tools, VR, Education, and Social Media. He studied at IDC, IIT Bombay, 
                        specializing in Interaction Design focused on education - projects there included a phygital nature 
                        trail experience, research on using Whatsapp based homework and designing a reading app around open-source 
                        animated stories. More recently he worked with Inspirit VR, an edtech startup, designing VR simulations for 
                        Science education and piloting them in schools across the US and India.

                    <p class="speaker_talk_brief">Virtual classrooms and the metaverse were all the rage right after COVID. 
                        Collaborative spaces and 3D technology brings a significant change to education, however, the tech 
                        stack can be very expensive to build on and to access. I began to play around with code to create simple
                         equivalents to best features of VR simulations including immersive environments and independent exploration. 
                         I'll be sharing some of my early prototypes in P5 and JS and discussing observations from pilots in schools with VR.

                    <p class="speaker_blurb">Rashmi is a master's of information design student at NID bangalore, 
                        previously trained as an architect, she has always been interested in speculative ideas at 
                        the intersection of technology and design. She likes to experiment with different narratives 
                        and processes.She often like to observe and find patterns and interconnections among various 
                        things in nature and human beings.

                    <h3 class="speaker_talk_topic">3D Metaverse for Education</h3>
                    <p class="speaker_talk_brief">This project aimed to delve into and comprehend the systems of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). 
                        Through the categorization of individuals based on the MBTI and real-life comparisons, 
                        it was observed that the classifications are more of a spectrum rather than absolute categories. 
                        To visually represent this spectrum, a visualization utilizing basic shapes and colors was developed. 
                        The interactive process involved users inputting their MBTI type and percentages, which resulted in the 
                        generation of their unique badge. The coding aspect of the project utilized the p5.js framework, enabling 
                        the creation of dynamic and visually engaging visuals. Overall, the project provided an innovative and visually
                         intuitive way to explore and understand the nuances of MBTI types.
