                        p5.
                        It will start with just understanding patterns, then some basic code/math to see how we create
                        grids in p5.
                        Finally, there will be some live coding involved and a pre-sketch where people with their

                        He wonders what could be produced if fast, accurate, stupid machines work in symbiosis with
                        slow, inaccurate,
                        brilliant human beings to produce creative output.
                        A designer, through & through, Arjun currently works as a design researcher in the day with
                        TinkerLabs,
                        attempting to solve complex social problems with behaviour design. At night, he experiments with
                        algorithms to produce images.
                        An advocate of interdisciplinary approaches, he previously worked with Science Gallery Bengaluru
                        as an Xperimenter,

                    <p class="speaker_talk_brief">In Between Life & Death is a web-game, made with p5.js, that attempts
                        to explore why human beings do the things they do.
                        Using Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs as the underlying system, players wake up as a
                        'conscious' particle in space compelled
                        by different human 'needs'. As the game progresses, fulfilling the needs becomes increasingly
                        more complex, and players ultimately
                        reach a grand ending - but is there one at all?
                        Dive into a zone of existential questioning as Arjun deconstructs the process of making his game
                        - discussing the inspiration,
                        conversion of Maslow's theory into a system of logic, stylistic choices and its resulting
                        impact.

                    <p class="speaker_talk_brief">Virtual classrooms and the metaverse were all the rage right after
                        COVID.
                        Collaborative spaces and 3D technology brings a significant change to education, however, the
                        tech
                        stack can be very expensive to build on and to access. I began to play around with code to

                        equivalents to best features of VR simulations including immersive environments and independent

                        I'll be sharing some of my early prototypes in P5 and JS and discussing observations from pilots
                        in schools with VR.

                    <p class="speaker_talk_brief">This project aimed to delve into and comprehend the systems of the
                        Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).
                        Through the categorization of individuals based on the MBTI and real-life comparisons,
                        it was observed that the classifications are more of a spectrum rather than absolute categories.
                        To visually represent this spectrum, a visualization utilizing basic shapes and colors was
                        developed.
                        The interactive process involved users inputting their MBTI type and percentages, which resulted
                        in the
                        generation of their unique badge. The coding aspect of the project utilized the p5.js framework,
                        enabling
                        the creation of dynamic and visually engaging visuals. Overall, the project provided an
                        innovative and visually
                        intuitive way to explore and understand the nuances of MBTI types.

                    <p class="speaker_talk_brief">Algorave — short for algorithmic rave — is a performance format and
                        underground
                        movement that revolves around the practice of live-coding, that is, writing and editing code
                        live in front
                        of an audience to create music and visuals. Live coding has been a medium for performing arts
                        for almost
                        three decades, but it was usually restricted to either the art world or tech and trans-media
                        events.
                        In 2012, Sheffield-based musicians Alex McLean, Nick Collins and other UK based livecoders
                        decided to
                        take live coding into the club environment, organizing live coding jams at local music venues
                        under the
                        Algorave banner.<br>
